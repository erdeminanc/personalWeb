Hi there,

I have always liked making things, this became a professional career eventually. I like turning ideas into software products. I started this journey by teaching myself programming with C and Python. Then Java.

After studying in Istanbul Technical University, I received a master's degree from Sabanci University in Information Technologies.

My techstack includes but not limited to creating backend using Spring/Spring Boot(Java), creating frontend using Vue, React(Javascript) and setting up microservice architecture using Kubernetes, Docker and Microsoft Azure services. I am always open to learning innovative technologies.

I am currently working as **Sr. Software Developer** in **Anadolu Sigorta**.
